# Shoppers-Intention-Analysis

The goal for this project is to identify which of the following classification algorithms can best predict the likelihood that an online shopper makes a purchase: (1) Random Forest Classifier, (2) Support Vector Machine, (3) K Nearest Neighbors, or (4) Logistic Regression. I use the f1 score as a metric to compare the above algorithms.  

I use time series data set on shoppers' behavior. The data set spans 10 months and includes 18 variables, including the target variable: Revenue. 

This analysis takes the following structure: 

    1. Data visualization.
    2. Feature Engineering.
    3. Cross Validation.
    4. Conclusion. 
    
I find that the Random Forest Classifier has the highest f1 score.
